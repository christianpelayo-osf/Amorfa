Introduction

This is a fancy new component built off the the original OSF Pallet Utilization component. 

This is made to be 'Shipping Unit' generic where we can replace the original 'Pallet' Labels with anything we want (box, carton etc). Have also fixed a couple of bugs and allowed more customisation from a functional perspective on the community.
