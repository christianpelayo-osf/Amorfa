INTRODUCTION
----
Enables the display of a banner on a community. We can configure the following
1. The text, text colour and background colour
2. Allow the banner to be closed (i.e. hidden) from the page by the user, by showing an X button
3. A unique id that can be shared across multiple banners. This enables persistance where if a banner is closed, other banners with the same id also close.
